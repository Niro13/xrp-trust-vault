# XRP Trust Vault+

**Freedom with backup. Human-secured custody on XRPL.**

XRP Trust Vault+ is a decentralized, human-centric custody layer built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL).  
It empowers individuals and institutions to retain full self-custody of their digital assets—  
while adding a fallback mechanism for recovery, inheritance, and integration with the real world.
